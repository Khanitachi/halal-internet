# Halal Internet

## Vision
- Make Internet 100% Halal

## Mission
- Build a tool that filters Haram/Makruh and ‘covers’ it appropriately without disrupting the user experience.


## What to solve

The internet is filled with Haram (forbidden) and Makruh (disliked) elements.
This inflicts the eyes (video, text, image), ears (audio) and thoughts (concept) leading to weakening and even loss of Iman.
We cannot ask the nation to stop using the Internet as it is a source of prosperity.

So we should make it safer for the Muslims, by filtering out the forbidden elements and making it 100% Halal.


## Why to solve

Muslims preferably stay away from consuming Haram in all forms. But the internet presents the forbidden and disliked elements in ways that is mostly unpredictable and unavoidable. Filtering them will make internet usage safer and Halal for the Muslims.


## How to solve

The term hijab means 'to cover' and the idea is to provide a real time 'cover/hijab' for the internet users so they can safeguard themselves against the prohibited/disliked/doubtful elements of the internet.


## For whom to solve

For the sake of Allah and His Beloved ﷺ we want to solve this problem for the whole Ummah.

A good starting point will be with the image format, for those who are serious about their religion and frequent the internet, aged between 18-35.


## Solutions available in the market right now are as follows:
- **[Tahir](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tahir/ihmoammkfbdpokfiiifajdkfglmfejca) :** This Google Extension (GE) blurs images and videos and gives the option of manual unbluring and customizable blur settings. (((Blanket solution)))
- **[Nudity Filter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nudity-filter/ccjomchggbfngggjahebgahghoomiegm) :** This GE detects skin color pixels and replaces them with grey color. (((Relatively more nuanced than Tahir. Not valid for videos. Disrupts the user experience as grey color looks unpleasant)))
- **[Unhook](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unhook-remove-youtube-rec/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid) :** This GE opens up the option to edit the YouTube webpage as per the users convenience. (((Flexible solution. Still doesn’t solve content level problem. Not useful outside YouTube)))

- **[vRate](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/smart-internet-porn-filte/hikjbimjpogeajolkcggpbhjdlpifcmk) :** This GE utilises AI to analyze images and cover them up with a banner. Customizable AI settings (((Closest alternative to our proposed solution. AI not as intelligent. Works only for images)))

- **[Censei](https://devpost.com/software/censei-q7i08o) :** This GE replaces explicit words with emojis (((Highly effective. Works only on text.)))

- **[HaramBlur](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/haramblur/pbcoegikffnadpahojjhgdladmmddeji/related?fbclid=IwAR3VinEHab-ezUgDEhEMnS3uw5PMN1Ej8c_fM_8zYMEQIooB_MzRqga7MA4) :** This GE usis AI to detect NSFW and blurs them ((Effective yet blanket solution. Works on Images and Video front and not video content level, recently launched, needs more developement))

- **Google Safe Search :** This feature filters out all NSFW and adult search results. (((Highly effective, but not useful on content level.)))

- **Porn Blocking Extensions and Tools :** These tools block access to adult sites by redirecting access attempts to a whitelisted website. (((Highly effective)))

## Criticism

Most of these tools face the following shortcomings:

- **Blanket Solution -** While a blanket solution like blocking works in case of adult websites as these are 100% Haram. Yet, similar solution won’t work for websites which may have both Haram and Halal elements like Facebook, YouTube, etc. On the other hand, tools like Tahir and Nudity Filter take a step further by working on content level. But they still don’t solve the problem properly as they do not engage any intelligence to judge the content and hide/blur them irrespective of whether the content is Halal or Haram.
- **Unislamic Solution -** Although Google’s Safe Search and similar tools works successfully, but they work on the principles laid down by a company and not by Allah. Most profit making companies chase engagement, retention and revenue and no one is stopping them from retweaking their safe searching filtering mechanism to suit their north star metrics whenever they find it convenient.
- **Unfriendly -** Most of the tools have been built to ‘censor’, while not much have been to make sure the user’s experience is enhanced or at least stays intact as much as possible.

## Media and Message
Content consumption process has two elements:
- **Media -** words, images, sounds, colors, music
- **Message -** the meaning the content conveys

>Both the Media and Message can have Halal, Haram and Makruh elements.

Examples:
- **Porn -** Media 100% Haram, Message 100% Haram
- **Instagram Post on Nutrition in Pork -** Media 100% Halal, Message 100% Haram
- **Text article supporting LGBTQ -** Media 100% Makruh, Message 100% Haram

>Hence, both the Media and Message requires proper dealing in there own way.

>Media needs covering, Message requires Islamic context.


## Proposed design of the solution
The solution needs to be -


- **Islamic -** the guiding principle of building this platform should come from Islam. Period.
- **Unburdening -** the tool should provide both the prevention and cure against Haram in the most friendly way.
- **Nuanced -** the tool should read and understand Haram in both media and message level and also provide the right ‘cover/hijab’ for the same

>Considering the fact that we **<ins>do not</ins>** want to encroach our users by locking or disabling things **<ins>outside their control</ins>**, it is essential to build this tool so that it eases the way of making the internet experience halal, however the users’ want it to.

>Each Muslim is treading there own journey towards Allah. And we respect that.


And we want to <ins>**ease**</ins> that journey by providing protection from Haram without being forceful.

## How should this work?
- **Step 1:** The tool processes the Haram and Makruh elements
- **Step 2:** It ‘covers/hijabs’ the content at real time
- **Step 3:** The control of the type of ‘cover/hijab’ remains in the hands of the users

### Content that is:
- Halal should be open for consumption
- Haram should be covered by default and proper context and access to the Islamic ruling is to be provided to the user
- Makruh should be warned against and the user is to be given proper context and easy access to the respective Islamic ruling

>The user must have one click access to the Islamic stand point about anything that is covered up or is warned against.

### This should work like Grammarly.

- Grammarly’s 1st layer of user experience (UX) improvement - **Grammar Correction**. Simple improvements. Cross checks with English grammar rules and suggests the changes.

- Grammarly’s 2nd layer of **UX improvement** - suggesting better synonyms, removing redundancies, improving the style of writing (like, formal, informal, storytelling) etc. Complex in nature. The tool needs the intelligence to understand the message, the intention and style of the writer from the text, to suggest changes. The more trained the tool is, the more accurate it’s suggestions.

### In our case-

**<ins>1st layer of UX improvement</ins> -** 
- covering the prohibited and doubtful contents.
- Simple in nature.
- Searches for the prohibited/disliked elements in the content and ‘covers’ it.
>For example -
Blurring the satr of male and female in images and videos
Beeping slangs in audio

**<ins>2nd layer of UX improvement</ins> -** 
- providing the correct context and information to the user.
- Complex in nature.

>**<ins>For example -</ins>**
>1. Ms Marvel (a comic book character) is shown fantasizing about having pork. Such nuanced contents cannot be simply covered up as the mere image does not show any profanity or Haram elements, but the message it conveys is questionable and needs an explanation.
>2. Similarly, an article on LGBTQ needs proper addresal from an Islamic point of view as just covering up the content doesn’t solve the problem completely.
>3. Lastly, matters related to money, investment, business, stock market, medical conditions, etc, which requires deeper understanding of the Islamic law and has multiple layers of Haram and Halal involved in it. The user journey of accessing the information and understanding them all, is pretty cumbersome.
